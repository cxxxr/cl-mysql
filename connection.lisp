   Use dont-release if you don't want cl-mysql to release all the resources
   when the last result set has been processed.   This might be useful, for
   instance, if you need access to the fields through result-set-fields after
   the result set has been processed.

   You can, if you wish elect to not process each individual row of a result
   set by setting :store T.   However, you cannot then use next-row because
   you must process the entire result set in one go.
